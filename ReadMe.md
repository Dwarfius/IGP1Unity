A university project developed by a team of 6 1st-year students (1 programmer, 3 artists, 1 designer, 1 psychology). It is a RC controlled arcade racing game, where the player has to finish 3 laps first versus 5 AI controlled opponents. Features multiple heroes/cars with different statistics, multiple power-ups and a big race track based in a cinema.

The AI controlled cars are following a steering behavior algorithm, which utilizes "tunnel"-like information baked in to the level. If the car's future position (in 1 seconds time) is outside of the defined tunnel, it should start steering away from it. By tweaking the time offset, the steering strength and acceleration ratios, each race track can have its own specific AI players.
